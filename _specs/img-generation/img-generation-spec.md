# Image Generation System Overview with fal.ai API Integration

## Storage Locations

- **LoRA files**: `GCP_LORA_FILES_BUCKET_NAME=halloween-costume-loras`
- **Generated images**: `GCP_USER_IMG_GENERATED_BUCKET_NAME=halloween-costume-generated-images`

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of the image generation system using the fal.ai `flux-lora` model. The system allows users to generate images based on a custom prompt and a selected LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model. LoRA models are stored in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) bucket and accessed via signed URLs to ensure secure and temporary access for the fal.ai API.

## Inputs

1. **Prompt**:
   - Users enter a free-form text prompt directly into the frontend interface.
   - The prompt should describe the desired image to be generated.

2. **LoRA Model Selection**:
   - Users select from existing LoRA models retrieved from the `loras` table in the database.
   - LoRA models are fetched via the `/api/get-lora-models` endpoint.
   - Each model includes metadata such as `id`, `personId`, `url`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `trigger`, `model`, and `modelVersion`.

3. **Number of Images**:
   - Users select the number of images to generate, ranging from **1 to 5**.

4. **Image Size**:
   - Users can select from predefined options or enter custom dimensions:
     - **Predefined Options**:
       - Square HD (512x512)
       - Square (512x512)
       - Portrait 4:3 (768x1024)
       - Portrait 16:9 (896x504)
       - Landscape 4:3 (1024x768)
       - Landscape 16:9 (1280x720)
     - **Custom Resolution**:
       - Users can input custom width and height values.

5. **Guidance Scale** (optional):
   - Users can adjust the guidance scale, with a default value of 4.

## Outputs

- **Generated Images**:
  - Quantity: Corresponds to the user's selection (1-5 images).
  - Resolution: Matches the selected image size or custom dimensions.
  - Format: JPEG images accessible via signed URLs provided in the response.
  - Metadata: Includes `width`, `height`, `content_type`, and storage details (`fullUrl`, `bucket`, `path`).

## Process Overview

### 1. User Interface Interaction

- The `ImageGenerationPage` component provides an interface for users to:
  - Select a LoRA model from a dropdown menu populated via `/api/get-lora-models`.
  - Enter a custom prompt.
  - Choose the number of images to generate.
  - Select a predefined image size or enter custom dimensions.
  - Optionally adjust the guidance scale.
- The interface validates that a LoRA model is selected and the prompt is not empty.

### 2. LoRA Model Retrieval

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/get-lora-models`
- **Process**:
  - Retrieves all LoRA models from the `loras` table in the database.
  - For each model, generates a signed URL for the LoRA file stored in GCP.
    - Supports various URL formats:
      - Full HTTP(S) URLs
      - `gs://` URLs
      - Relative paths or filenames
    - Uses the default bucket name `GCP_LORA_FILES_BUCKET_NAME` if necessary.
  - Returns a JSON array of LoRA models with an added `signedUrl` field.

- **Sample Response**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "personId": 101,
      "url": "lora1.safetensors",
      "signedUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/...",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "trigger": "johndoe",
      "model": "flux-lora",
      "modelVersion": "v1.0"
    },
    // ... more models
  ]
  ```

### 3. API Request to Backend

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/generate-image`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "prompt": "A portrait of johndoe in a haunted house.",
    "loraId": 1,
    "num_images": 3,
    "image_size": {
      "width": 512,
      "height": 1024
    },
    "guidance_scale": 4
  }
  ```

### 4. Backend Processing

- **LoRA Model Details Retrieval**:
  - Fetches the LoRA model details from the database based on `loraId`.
  - Validates that the LoRA model exists.
- **Signed URL Generation for LoRA File**:
  - Constructs the full path to the LoRA file in GCP.
  - Generates a signed URL for the LoRA file with a 15-minute expiration.
  - Handles various URL formats (full URLs, `gs://`, relative paths).
- **Preparation of fal.ai API Request**:
  - Constructs the API request to the fal.ai `flux-lora` model with parameters:
    - `prompt`: User-provided prompt.
    - `loras`: Includes the signed URL to the LoRA file and weight (`scale: 1.0`).
    - `num_images`: Number of images to generate.
    - `image_size`: Object containing `width` and `height` values or predefined size.
    - `guidance_scale`: User-provided value or default (4).
    - `sync_mode`: Set to `true` for synchronous processing.
  - Uses the `@fal-ai/serverless-client` package for making the API call.
- **API Call to fal.ai**:
  - Submits the image generation request.
  - Logs progress updates during generation.
  - Receives a response containing image URLs and metadata.
- **Image Handling**:
  - Downloads images from the fal.ai-provided URLs.
  - Uploads images to the GCP bucket `halloween-costume-generated-images`.
    - Generates a signed URL for each uploaded image with a 24-hour expiration.
  - Saves images in a folder named after `loraId` in `public/generated-images/`.
  - Stores metadata in the `generated_images` table, including:
    - `loraId`, `fullUrl`, `bucket`, `path`, `prompt`, and `seed`.

### 5. Response Handling

- The backend responds with a JSON object containing:
  - An array of image objects with signed URLs and metadata.
  - The seed used for image generation.
  - The prompt used.

- **Sample Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "images": [
      {
        "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/halloween-costume-generated-images/generated_1234567890_0.jpg",
        "fullUrl": "halloween-costume-generated-images/generated_1234567890_0.jpg",
        "bucket": "halloween-costume-generated-images",
        "path": "generated_1234567890_0.jpg",
        "width": 768,
        "height": 1024,
        "content_type": "image/jpeg"
      },
      // ... more image objects
    ],
    "seed": 1234567890,
    "prompt": "A portrait of johndoe in a haunted house."
  }
  ```

### 6. Frontend Display

- The frontend receives the response and displays the images in a grid.
- Images are sorted by generation time (using a `timestamp` field) for easy viewing.
- Animations are used for a smooth user experience.

## Error Handling

- **Frontend Validation**:
  - Ensures a LoRA model is selected.
  - Checks that the prompt is not empty.
- **Backend Error Handling**:
  - Uses try-catch blocks for API calls and file operations.
  - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
  - Logs errors with descriptive messages and error details.
  - Handles specific error cases, such as:
    - Missing required parameters.
    - LoRA model not found in the database.
    - Failure to generate signed URLs.
    - No images generated by fal.ai.
    - Failure to save images to GCP or the database.

- **Sample Error Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "An unexpected error occurred while generating or saving images.",
    "details": "Error message here"
  }
  ```

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys and Credentials**:
  - Stored securely using environment variables.
  - Environment variables include `FAL_KEY`, `GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `GCP_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `GCP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- **Authentication and Rate Limiting**:
  - Implemented on the `/api/generate-image` endpoint to prevent abuse.
  - Could use middleware or API gateway features for rate limiting.
- **Signed URLs**:
  - LoRA files and generated images are accessed via short-lived signed URLs.
  - LoRA file URLs expire in 15 minutes.
  - Generated image URLs expire in 24 hours.
- **Data Sanitization**:
  - User inputs (e.g., `prompt`) are sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **Error Messages**:
  - Do not expose sensitive information in error messages.

## Performance Optimization

- **Image Display**:
  - Images are displayed in a responsive grid with lazy loading if needed.
- **Caching**:
  - Potential caching of frequently used LoRA models on the backend.
- **Parallel Processing**:
  - Backend handles multiple image generation requests in parallel.
- **Resource Cleanup**:
  - Ensures that database connections are properly closed after use.

## Future Enhancements

- **Custom Prompt Construction**:
  - Add UI elements to help users construct prompts using predefined fields like age, gender, costume, etc.
- **Negative Prompts Support**:
  - Allow users to specify elements to exclude from the generated images.
