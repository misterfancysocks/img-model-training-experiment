# Application Overview

## Purpose

- The Halloween Costume application allows users to generate images of themselves or their children in various Halloween costumes using AI technology.

## Service Provided to Users

- **Personalized Profiles**: Users create profiles for each person they want to generate costumes for, providing details like name, birthdate, gender, ethnicity, and costume interests.
- **Image Upload and Processing**: During profile creation, users are required to upload photos, which are processed using AI to remove backgrounds and generate captions.
- **Review Uploaded Photos**: Users have the option to review and manage their uploaded photos before proceeding.
- **AI-Generated Costumes**: The application generates images of the users in Halloween costumes based on their inputs.
- **Dynamic Costume Generation**: Users can input new costume ideas at any time and generate additional images on-the-fly.
- **Image Carousel Interface**: A user-friendly interface where users can view and download their generated images individually.

## Monetization

- **Credit-Based System**: The application uses a credit system where users purchase credits to generate images.
- **Pricing Packages**: Various packages are available on the Pricing page, offering different amounts of credits at different price points.
- **Payment Processing**: All payments are securely processed through Stripe.
- **Credit Consumption**: Credits are deducted from the userâ€™s account when new images are generated.

By modifying the documentation, we've integrated the requirement for users to upload photos during the **Profile Setup** phase. The photo upload is now a mandatory step on the same page where users enter the 'person' details. After uploading photos, users are provided with the option to **'Review Uploaded Photos'** before proceeding.

Key changes include:

- **Profile Setup with Photo Upload**: The `profiles/new/page.tsx` now requires users to upload photos as part of the profile creation process.
- **Review Uploaded Photos**: Added a new page `profiles/review-photos/page.tsx` where users can review, crop, rotate, and manage their uploaded photos before submission.
- **User Flow Adjustments**: Steps 8 and 9 in the **New Users** flow have been updated to reflect the new process, combining profile creation and photo upload, followed by photo review.
- **Technical Process Flow**: Adjusted to include photo review and selection as a distinct step after data collection.

This ensures that users are fully engaged in the photo upload process during profile creation and have the opportunity to review and manage their photos before the system processes them for AI model training and image generation.
